# Rollback Ledger

2026-10-22 WS-007/008 bilingual UI: start `61b1bf1`, branch `feat/frontend-bilingual`; scope limited to frontend, its browser scripts, shipped static assets and verification docs. Fresh checks: 213 frontend tests plus production/demo builds and fixture browser flows passed. Rollback is a normal revert of the eventual isolated local feature commit, preserving unrelated work; no reset/clean or backend/schema changes are needed. No remote push or merge is part of this change.
